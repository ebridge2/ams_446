# Installation

Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ebridge2/ams_446.git
```

Once in the repository's directory:

```
python setup.py install
```

I think all of the installation requirements are provided, so none should be missing. Now, you can open a notebook and start playing around, or open a terminal. The package will be installed for you into your python packages for future use.
